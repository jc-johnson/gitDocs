Key Terms:

Try - lets you test a block of code for errors
Catch - lets you handle the error
Throw - lets you create custom errors
Finally - lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result

Notes:

Throwing errors makes debugging MUCH easier. Gives you hints as to what went wrong.

Include function name in error message. 

The best place to throw an error is in utility functions - functions that are part of
general programming environment and might be used in a number of places.
Only throw errors where they will already occur.

Use errors from libraries' public interfaces which give you known error conditions.

Never have a try-catch statement with an empty catch clause. Always handle 
the error in some way. Don't just simply wrap an error in a try-catch block,
you must deal with it in someway (throw statement). 

Throwing errors is an art.
