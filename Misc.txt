-When building something, google what methods you might need.
Before deep diving an learning how a particular method works too soon.
Make sure it is a method that you will need to build your program.

-Run small tests on new methods

-Copy and paste examples. Don't spend all the time to retype them.
Take time to understand what everything does. Modify example as 
needed
-The methods you see in examples and others' code might help you
solve previous problems

-An array is the same thing as a pointer
char[] same as char*
a char is an int in C
a char * can get &value

-A large part of building a program is starting by building 
something you do know. And identifying what you don't know how
to do yet as quickly as possible. Weed out weakensses in 
your understanding as ruthlessly as possible

-Strings In C

The right solution is usually simple, elegant, and beautiful
