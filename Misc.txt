-When building something, google what methods you might need.
Before deep diving an learning how a particular method works too soon.
Make sure it is a method that you will need to build your program.

-Run small tests on new methods

Take time to understand what everything does. Modify example as 
needed
-The methods you see in examples and others' code might help you
solve previous problems
